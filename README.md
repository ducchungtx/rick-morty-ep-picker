## Tech Stack

**Built with**

- React 16.8.5
- TypeScript
- [hookrouter](https://github.com/Paratron/hookrouter)

## Features & Motivation

This is the learning repo for **[Typescript with modern React (i.e. hooks, context, suspense)](https://www.udemy.com/typescript-with-react-hooks-and-context/)** by [Richard Bray](https://github.com/RichardBray).

It uses modern React features like Hooks, Context and Suspense and is written in TypeScript.

This app fetches a list of Rick & Morty episodes and allows you to choose favorite episodes.

Routing is done with [hookrouter](https://parastudios.de/modern-and-clean-routing-with-hooks/), a minimalist module that uses React Hooks for client-side routing.
